                    <p>
                        I love English because It can
                        <u>help me to explore more things</u> in a different
                        language and horizon.

                    <p>
                        The main reason why I like to learn math is that It can
                        <strong>help me to develop my brain</strong>

                    <p>
                        The reason why I like Art is because It is
                        <strong>one of the good ways for me to enjoy.</strong> I
                        like to draw

                    <p>
                        I like PE, as
                        <u>I may escape from exhausting</u>(studying a lot in
                        school). While we act in PH subject with my classmates,
                        I feel like a happy person,
                        <strong>especially if we play football.</strong>
